They had invested in all the right gear, but the room itself was a bit of a disaster. We're talking bare walls, hardwood floors, and a low ceiling - it was a sonic nightmare. I ended up spending more time trying to tame the reflections and echoes than actually recording the music. It just goes to show that even with the best equipment, a poorly treated room can really hold you back. Have you ever had to deal with a challenging recording space, and if so, how did you overcome it?"
