I've definitely noticed that when I'm working in a space that sounds great, I'm more likely to experiment and try new things. And on the other hand, when the room is sounding subpar, it can be really frustrating and stifle the creative process. As for common mistakes people make when it comes to acoustic treatment, I think one of the biggest ones is not taking the time to properly assess the room before starting to treat it. You know, just slapping up some absorption panels or diffusion products without really understanding the specific acoustic issues in the room can be a waste of time and money. I've seen people put up absorption panels in all the wrong places, or use the wrong type of material for the specific frequency range they're trying to target. It's really important to take the time to measure the room, identify the problem areas, and come up with a thoughtful plan for treatment. Another mistake I see people make is not considering the whole frequency spectrum when it comes to acoustic treatment. You know, a lot of people focus on just the high-end reflections and forget about the low-end buildup, or vice versa. But the truth is, a well-treated room needs to sound great across the entire frequency range, from the lowest lows to the highest highs. And finally, I think people often underestimate the importance of diffusion in a room. Absorption is important, don't get me wrong, but diffusion is what helps to create a sense of space and airiness, and can really make a room sound alive. By incorporating diffusion products or designing the room with diffusion in mind, you can create a space that not only sounds accurate and controlled, but also feels inspiring and creative."
