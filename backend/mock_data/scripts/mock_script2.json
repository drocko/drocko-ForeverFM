I mean, we didn't have a huge budget to work with, but I've found that sometimes the simplest and most cost-effective approaches can be just as effective as the fancy commercial products. I started by identifying the worst offending areas of the room - in this case, it was the walls and the ceiling - and then I began to brainstorm ways to absorb or diffuse the sound. We ended up using a combination of thick blankets, moving pads, and even some homemade acoustic panels made from Owens Corning 703 and fabric to cover the walls and ceiling. It was amazing how much of a difference it made - the reverberation time decreased significantly, and the singer's voice sounded much more controlled and focused. And the best part was, it didn't break the bank. I think it's a great example of how, with a little bit of knowledge and some resourcefulness, you can really transform a challenging recording space into a functional and even great-sounding room."
